# Removing Images in Docker üê≥

## Understanding Docker Images and Layers

When you run `docker images`, you see a list of images that Docker has stored on your system. Each image can have a repository name, a tag, and an ID. However, some images may appear without a name or tag‚Äîthese are known as **dangling images**.

### Docker Images Command Output

```bash
# docker images
```

**Output:**

```bash

### Identifying Dangling Images üï∏Ô∏è

- **Dangling Images**: These are images that have no name and no tag (indicated as `<none>`). They are often the result of building an image without tagging it or when a new image is built and the old image layers are left behind without references. 
- **Tangling Images**: They have no relationship with any tagged images and can be considered "orphaned" layers. They consume space but are not directly associated with any useful image.

**Example**:
- The image with ID `defbc1fc22d8` created about an hour ago is a dangling image because it has `<none>` for both the repository and tag.

### Removing Dangling Images

To clean up these dangling images, you can use the `docker image prune` command.

```bash
docker image prune
```

**Output:**

```bash
WARNING! This will remove all dangling images.
Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y    
Deleted Images:
deleted: sha256:892afa4b32d01d7903b164cd1d9f0c719ceecdfbdce9660d6280f2b7df19453c
deleted: sha256:defbc1fc22d8f38b661087f394cc7056ba0b0314233e174fcd6220d0395a4339
Total reclaimed space: 0B
```

### Understanding the Pruning Output

- **Deleted Images**: Docker deletes the dangling images by their SHA256 digest (e.g., `sha256:892afa4b32d01d7903b164cd1d9f0c719ceecdfbdce9660d6280f2b7df19453c`).
- **Reclaimed Space**: Shows the amount of disk space reclaimed by removing these images. In this case, it reclaimed `0B`, likely because the deleted images were just untagged layers and not taking additional space.

### Pruning Containers Associated with Tangling Images

After pruning images, you may still have containers associated with these dangling images. To remove these stopped containers, use the `docker container prune` command.

```bash
docker container prune
```

**Output:**

```bash
WARNING! This will remove all stopped containers.
Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y
Deleted Containers:
ce8141d01446ed837e81300d90ec60735ab0faaeab162a79ce45dba6773143e3
b47af4bbffa3c52feb890663461a662c799a457cc79ad1bdc2d5baf70e558ff4
...
Total reclaimed space: 437.3MB
```

### Explanation of Docker Image and Container Pruning

- **Image Pruning**: Removes all images that do not have a repository or tag associated with them, effectively cleaning up unused layers.
- **Container Pruning**: Removes all stopped containers, including those that were using the pruned dangling images.

### Running Docker Image Prune Again

Running the prune command again ensures that all remaining dangling images are removed.

```bash
docker image prune
```

**Output:**

```bash
WARNING! This will remove all dangling images.
Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y
Deleted Images:
deleted: sha256:eb96803fcb7111db0feef85cc7010986ac849aa66b5be49782ee0aa81adf8d84

...
Total reclaimed space: 0B
```

### Checking Remaining Images

After pruning, you can check which images remain using `docker images`.

```bash
docker images
```

**Output:**

```bash
REPOSITORY                                                                         TAG

### Removing Specific Images by Name or ID

You can remove specific images by their name or image ID using `docker image rm`.

```bash
docker image rm 01_docker_helloworld-web c610e9b4537c hello-world
```

**Output:**

```bash
Untagged: 01_docker_helloworld-web:latest

### Final Check of Remaining Images

After removing the specific images, check the remaining images again:

```bash
docker images
```

**Output:**

```bash
REPOSITORY          TAG       IMAGE ID

       CREATED             SIZE  
react-app           latest    7bbe58d0a548   About an hour ago   489MB 
docker-helloworld   latest    7dff67261a5e   45 hours ago        171MB 
alpine              latest    324bc02ae123   2 weeks ago         7.8MB

```

### Docker Image Command Overview

The `docker image` command offers various options to manage images:

```bash
docker image
```

**Output:**

```bash
Usage:  docker image COMMAND

Manage images

Commands:
  build       Build an image from a Dockerfile
  history     Show the history of an image
  import      Import the contents from a tarball to create a filesystem image
  inspect     Display detailed information on one or more images
  load        Load an image from a tar archive or STDIN

  push        Upload an image to a registry
  rm          Remove one or more images
  save        Save one or more images to a tar archive (streamed to STDOUT by default)
  tag         Create a tag TARGET_IMAGE that refers to SOURCE_IMAGE

Run 'docker image COMMAND --help' for more information on a command.
```

### Summary üìù

- **Dangling Images**: These are images without a repository or tag, often leftover from builds.
- **Prune Commands**: `docker image prune` and `docker container prune` help clean up unused images and containers.
- **Image Removal**: You can remove specific images by name or ID using `docker image rm`.
- **Best Practices**: Regularly prune and manage your images to keep your Docker environment clean and efficient.
